# Chess Website

## Overview
This project is a reboot of my previous final web design assignment. After receiving feedback from my teacher that the original website was not good enough, I redesigned the project as a fully functional chess game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game includes interactive gameplay, valid move highlighting, piece movement logic, turn based play, move history , and check/checkmate detection.
